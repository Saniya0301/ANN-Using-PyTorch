# PyTorch Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Example

This project implements a basic Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using **PyTorch**, following a tutorial video. The network includes data loading, preprocessing, model definition, training loop, evaluation, and saving of the model.

---

##  Features

- **Custom Model**: Built with `nn.Module` and `nn.Sequential`
- **Dataset & DataLoader**: Efficient batch processing with PyTorch utilities
- **Training Pipeline**:
  - Forward pass
  - Loss computation (e.g. Binary Cross-Entropy Loss)
  - Backward pass with optimizer (e.g. SGD or Adam)
- **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy measurement using `torch.no_grad()`
- **Model Saving & Loading**: (Optional) persist trained model for reuse
